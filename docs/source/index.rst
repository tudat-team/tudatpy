=============
TU Delft Astrodynamics Toolbox in Python, or tudatpy, is a library that
primarily exposes the powerful set of C++ libraries, Tudat. TudatPy
aims at accelerating the implementation of Tudat simulations, providing
an interface between Tudat and popular machine learning frameworks and
establishing a platform to provide quality education in the field of
astrodynamics.
