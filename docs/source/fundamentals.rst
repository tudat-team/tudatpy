Functions for fundamental astrodynamic calculations


This module contains a list of functions for fundamental astrodynamic calculations.
These functions are used in the other modules to perform more complex calculations,
but can also be used on their own for standalone calculations.

.. note:: The functions in this module are expected to be reorganized in the future.
