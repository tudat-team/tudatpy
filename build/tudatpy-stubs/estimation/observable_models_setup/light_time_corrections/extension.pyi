    Function for creating convergence settings for solving the light-time equation. Computing the light time
    :math:`s=t_{R}-t_{T}` between two receiver :math:`R` and transmitter :math:`T` requires the iterative
    solution of the following equation:
    
    .. math::
        t_{R} - t_{T} = c\\left(|\\mathbf{r}_{R}(t_{R}) - \\mathbf{r}_{T}(t_{T})| + \\Delta s(t_{R}, t_{T}, \\mathbf{r}_{R}(t_{R}), \\mathbf{r}_{T}(t_{T}))\\right)
    
    where either the reception time :math:`t_{R}` or the transmission time :math:`t_{T}` is kept fixed (reference link end time). The term :math:`\\Delta s` contains any
    deviations in the light-time from straight-line propagation at speed of light (relativistic corrections, media corrections, etc.). The algorithm starts
    at :math:`t_{R}=t_{T}`, and uses this to evaluate the right-hand side of the above equation. This leads to a new value of :math:`t_{R}` or :math:`t_{T}` (depending on which is kept fixed)
    and the right-hand side is re-evaluated in a new iteration. The input to this function defines the settings for when the iteration will terminate.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    iterate_corrections : bool, default = False
        Boolean denoting whether the terms :math:`\\Delta s` are recomputed at each iteration or not. If false, the corrections are calculated only on the first iteration. Afterwards, the value
        is kept fixed until convergence. Once preliminarily converged, the algorithm recomputes :math:`\\Delta s`, and continues the iteration (until proper convergence) while now recomputing
        :math:`\\Delta s` each iteration. Setting this input to false is typically safe, and is computationally more efficient.
    
    maximum_number_of_iterations : int, default = 50
        Maximum number of iterations taken by the algorithm. If this number of iterations is reached without convergence (as defined by ``absolute_tolerance`` input),
        the behaviour of the algorithm is defined by the ``failure_handling`` input.
    
    absolute_tolerance : float, default = nan
        Difference in :math:`t_{R}-t_{T}` between two consecutive iterations below which the algorithm is considered to be converged. Default value is nan, which means the default value is taken.
        The default value depends on the time representation used (1 ps for float; 1 fs for Time class)
    
    failure_handling : LightTimeFailureHandling, default = accept_without_warning
        Input defines behaviour when failing to converge within the required number of iterations. NOTE: the default value should be overridden for high-accuracy applications
    
    Returns
