    """Create a ΔV/C3 porkchop mission design plot of single time window-ΔV field.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    departure_body: str
        The name of the body from which the transfer is to be computed
    target_body: str
        The name of the body to which the transfer is to be computed
    departure_epochs: np.ndarray
        Discretized departure time window
    arrival_epochs: np.ndarray
        Discretized arrival time window
    delta_v: np.ndarray
        Array containing the ΔV of all coordinates of the grid of departure/arrival epochs
    C3: bool = False
        Whether to plot C3 (specific energy) instead of ΔV
    threshold: float = 10
        Upper threshold beyond which ΔV/C3 is not plotted. This is useful to mask regions of the plot where the ΔV/C3 is too high to be of interest.
    upscale: bool = False
        Whether to use interpolation to increase the resolution of the plot. This is not always reliable, and the detail generated cannot be relied upon for analysis. Its only purpose is aesthetic improvement.
    filled_contours: bool = True
        Whether to plot filled contours or else just the contour lines
    plot_out_of_range_field: bool = Tru
        Whether to plot the out-of-range field (ΔV/C3 above the threshold) in a different color
    plot_isochrones: bool = True
        Whether to plot the isochrone lines (constant time of flight) on the plot
    plot_global_optimum: bool = True
        Whether to mark the global optimum with a cross
    plot_minor_ticks: bool = True
        Whether to show minor ticks on the axes
    number_of_levels: int = 10
        The number of levels in the ΔV/C3 contour plot
    line_width: float = 0.5
        Width of the contour plot lines
    line_color: str = 'black'
        Color of the contour plot lines
    font_size: float = 7
        Font size of the contour plot labels
    label: str = False
        Label used to identify the contour plot in legends
    colorbar: bool = False
        Whether to plot a colorbar
    percent_margin: float = 5
        Empty margin between the axes of the plot and the plotted data
    fig: matplotlib.figure.Figure = None
        Figure on which to plot
    ax:  matplotlib.axes._axes.Axes = None
        Axis on which to plot
    figsize: tuple[int, int] = (8, 8)
        Size of the figure
    show: bool bool = True
        Whether to show the plot
    save: bool = False
        Whether to save the plot
    filename: str = 'porkchop.png'
        The filename used for the saved plot
