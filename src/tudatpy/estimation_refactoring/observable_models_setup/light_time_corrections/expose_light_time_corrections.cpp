         Base class to define criteria of light time convergence.

         Base class to define criteria of light time convergence.
         This class is not used for calculations of corrections, but is used for the purpose of defining the light time convergence criteria.
         Specific light time convergence criteria must be defined using an object derived from this class.
         Instances of this class are typically created via the :func:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.estimation_setup.observation.light_time_convergence_settings` function.

         Examples
         --------
         .. code-block:: python

             # Code snippet to show the creation of a LightTimeConvergenceCriteria object
