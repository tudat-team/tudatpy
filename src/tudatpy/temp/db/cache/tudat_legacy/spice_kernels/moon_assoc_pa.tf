   Purpose of update:
  
      Documentation now refers to DE421 kernels. Deprecated SPICE
      routines and their replacements are noted.

   Overview
   =====================================================================

   In the SPICE system, the default body-fixed reference frame
   associated with the Moon is named

       IAU_MOON

   The IAU_MOON reference frame is implemented via approximate formulas
   provided by the IAU report [1] and is not suitable for high-accuracy
   work.

   This kernel directs the SPICE system to associate the lunar
   "principal axis" reference frame

      MOON_PA

   with the Moon. 

   When this kernel is loaded via FURNSH, the SPICE frame system
   routines CNMFRM and CIDFRM, which identify the reference frame
   associated with a specified body, will indicate that the MOON_PA
   frame is associated with the Moon.  In addition, higher-level SPICE
   geometry routines that rely on the CNMFRM or CIDFRM routines will
   use the MOON_PA frame where applicable. As of the release date of
   this kernel, these SPICE routines are:

      ET2LST
      LSPCN
   
   Any code that calls these routines to obtain results
   involving lunar body-fixed frames are affected.  Within SPICE, the
   only higher-level system that is affected is the dynamic frame
   system.

   The deprecated (as of the N0062 SPICE Toolkit release) routines

      ILLUM
      SRFXPT
      SUBPT
      SUBSOL

   also make use of this kernel; however NAIF recommends that
   users instead call the following routines which, respectively,
   supersede those listed above:

      ILUMIN
      SINCPT
      SUBPNT
      SUBSLR

   The newer routines don't make use of frame association kernels;
   these routines accept the name of the target body-fixed
   frame as an input argument.

   Note:  to direct SPICE to associate the lunar mean Earth/polar 
   axis frame 

      MOON_ME

   with the Moon, load the kernel

      moon_assoc_me.tf

   rather than this one.



   Using this kernel
   =====================================================================

   This kernel must be loaded together with a lunar frame specification
   kernel and a binary lunar PCK.  Below an example meta-kernel that
   loads these files and a small program illustrating use of the
   meta-kernel are shown. The names of the kernels used here are
   current as of the release date of this kernel, but should not be
   assumed to be current at later dates.


      Example meta-kernel
      -------------------

      To use the meta-kernel shown below, the '@' characters must be
      replaced with backslash '\' characters.  Backslashes cannot be
      used in this comment block because they would confuse the SPICE
      text kernel parser.

      When the above example program is run using the example meta-kernel,
      and the (arbitrary) date 2008 Mar 18 00:00:00 UTC is used
      as the observation time, the output will be:

         Lunar body-fixed frame is MOON_PA
         Sub-Earth planetocentric longitude (deg):  5.03631326
         Sub-Earth planetocentric latitude  (deg): -1.63759776
