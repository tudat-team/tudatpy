# tudatpy

TU Delft Astrodynamics Toolbox in Python, or **tudatpy**, is a library that primarily exposes the powerful set of C++ 
libraries, [Tudat](https://tudat.tudelft.nl/). TudatPy aims at accelerating the implementation of Tudat simulations,
providing an interface between Tudat and popular machine learning frameworks and establishing a platform to provide 
quality education in the field of astrodynamics. See the [documentation](https://tudat-space.readthedocs.io) for more.
