GENERAL DESCRIPTION:
====================
This program is an example of how call the fortran routines
call_mcd and julian
from MATLAB to retrieve data from the Mars Climate Database.

PREREQUISITES:
==============
- The NetCDF library should be installed on your system.
  IMPORTANT WARNING: librairies NetCDF must have been compiled with -fPIC
  (i.e. position independent code) option.
- A fortran compiler.
- MATLAB.

BUILDING THE PROGRAMS:
======================
You should first edit the provided makefile 
file to match your system specificities
(set the path to the NetCDF library and compiler).

Compile the Fortran MCD source files to generate object file
MCD.o
using the makefile command:
make

You must then edit the MATLAB script make_mlb_call_mcd.m
to set the correct path to your NetCDF library.
Create mlb_call_mcd.mexa64 by executing in the MATLAB session the script:
matlab>make_mlb_call_mcd
Create mlb_julian.mexa64 by executing in the MATLAB session the script:
matlab>make_mlb_julian

USAGE:
======
The demo script provide a simple example of how to call 
the call_mcd() routine via calling mlb_call_mcd() and 
the julian() routine via calling mlb_julian().

In test_mlb2mcd.m, you should set the 'dset' string (line 55) to
the path where MCD datafiles are located on your system.
WARNING: Default maximum length is 50 characters (or else adapt 
definition in mlb_call_mcd.F).

Set the desirable input and dummy output parameters. 
WARNING: Dummy output parameters should be set before calling the 
function mlb_call_mcd() in order to allocate memory.

In  the MATLAB session run the Demo script:
matlab>test_mlb2mcd
