GENERAL DESCRIPTION:
====================
These programs are examples of how C and C++ programs may call upon
the fortran routine call_mcd in MCD.F90
to retrieve data from the Mars Climate Database.

PREREQUISITES:
==============
- The NetCDF library should be installed on your system.
- A fortran compiler.
- A C and/or C++ compiler.

BUILDING THE PROGRAMS:
======================
Before building the programs, you should edit them to change the
'dset' string to the path to the MCD datafiles on your system.
You should then edit the provided Makefile to match your system specificities
(path to the NetCDF library, compilers,... see the examples and comments
in the Makefile, as well as in the user's guide).

-The C program test_mcd.c can then be compiled using the following command:
make test_mcd_c

-Similarly, the C++ program is built by:
make test_mcd_cpp

USAGE:
======

Both programs behave similarly to the test_mcd.F90 fortran program and
provide a simple example of how to call the call_mcd routine of MCD.F90 module.

Given the same input than the fortran program "test_mcd", "test_mcd_c"
(and "test_mcd_cpp") will yield identical results.
