fmcd_gfortran.sh   Bash script to generate python interface fmcd.pyf
test_mcd.py        Example of a python script calling the mcd
test_mcd.def       Example of user inputs to test_mcd.py

GENERAL DESCRIPTION:
====================
The test_mcd.py python script is an illustrative example of how one may
call upon the fortran routine call_mcd to retreive data from the Mars Climate Database.

PREREQUISITES:
==============
- The NetCDF library should be installed on your system. Moreover, from our
  experience, it seems that it must have been build using the "-fPIC" (for
  gfortran; the name of the option changes with compilers) option which
  generates position independent code suitable for use in a shared library.
- The fcm_gfortran.sh bash script relies on "f2py" utility, which is part
  of the "numpy" package (see http://www.scipy.org/F2py)

BUILDING THE PYTHON INTERFACE:
==============================
- Edit and adapt the "fcm_gfortran.sh" bash script so that the paths to
  your local netcdf library and mcd distribution are used. Then simply run
  the script, and if all went well, files "fmcd.log", "fmcd.so" and "fmcd.pyf"
  should have been created. 
  In case the .so file has a different name, just rename it "fmcd.so"

USAGE:
======
The "test_mcd.py" script provides a simple and straightforward example of
how one can call the mcd from within a python script. When run it requires
some input from the user (hence the "test_mcd.def" file, for those who prefer
to redirect input from a file rather than type as the program proceeds).
