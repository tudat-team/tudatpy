How to test the "call_mcd" subroutine with the "test_mcd" program :
(note that this testcase suite uses dust scenarios 1 and 7, so at least these
 two must be available)

1) Compile test_mcd and ensure a symbolic link MCD_DATA 
   has been set up to the MCD data there 
   (ln -s /full/path/to/mcd/data MCD_DATA) as explained in the documentation.

2) Possibly modify TEST_SCRIPT as necessary to specify the location of
   test_mcd if it is not '..' anymore.

3) Execute TEST_SCRIPT, and watch...
   If all goes well, then the results of the testcases should match those
   you obtain. Compilers tend to treat long character strings differently
   so the tests may show many discrepencies about messages to output such
   as " Opening some_long_file_name"; these are obviously not a problem.
   You might also obtain, depending on compiler, comiler optimizing options,
   and compiler versions, some slightly different numercical values.

Test cases for the MCD :
