    """Compute Pareto optimums from a set of points.

    These points are all individually optimums, meaning that to be better in one dimension, they have to be worse in another one.

    This function also allows to specify wether each dimension (which can be seen as an optimisation objective), should be minimised or maximised.

    The set of points can indicate 2D or 3D coordinates, but can also extend to as many dimensions (and objectives) as one wants.

    Parameters
    ----------
    points : list or numpy.ndarray
        Multi-dimensional list that contains the set of points to compute Pareto optimums from.
        If the points are spread in 3D, this list should have 3 columns, and as many rows as there are points.
    operator : None or list[min or max], optional, default=None
        If None, it will be considered that the optimums are the minimums of each axis (dimension).
        Otherwise, a list of `min` or `max` functions can be passed in this input, to specify whether a point along a given dimension should be minimum or maximum to be considered optimum.

    Examples
    --------
    The following code defines a set of equispaced points in 3 dimensions, with spacing of 0.5, ranging from -0.5 to 1.
    
    Wether each of these points is a Pareto optimum is then computed, taking into account that an optimum is a minimum for x and y, and a maximum for z.

    Then, a 3D plot is made, showing the Pareto optimum points in green, and the other ones in red.
    The plot generated by this example code can be seen in the image below.
