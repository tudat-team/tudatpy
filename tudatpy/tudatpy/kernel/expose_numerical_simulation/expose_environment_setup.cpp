Function that creates an engine model (to be used for thrust calculations), and adds it to an existing body.

Function that creates an engine model (to be used for thrust calculations), and adds it to an existing body. It creates and
object of class :class:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.environment.EngineModel`, and adds it to an existing body. Properties
assigned to this engine model are:

* The (constant) direction in body-fixed frame in which the engine is pointing (e.g. the body-fixed thrust direction when the engine is on)

Function that creates a flight conditions, and adds it to an existing body.

This function can be used to add  a :class:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.environment.FlightConditions` object to an existing body.
Typically, the ``FlightConditions`` are created automatically when they are required (for the calculation of an
aerodynamic acceleration, or the saving of certain dependent variables). However, in some cases it may be useful
to manually trigger their creation, which is done through this function. If the ``central_body_name`` input
denotes a body that is endowed with an :class:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.environment.AtmosphereModel`, this function
automatically creates an :class:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.environment.AtmosphericFlightConditions` object (capable of
calculating density, speed of sound, etc.), instead of the more basic :class:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.environment.FlightConditions`
(which is limited to properties such as altitude, latitude, etc.)

    Object defining the physical environment, with all properties of artificial and natural bodies.

    Name of the body for which the flight conditions are to be created
