    """"
    This function solved Lambert's problem for a transfer from the `departure_body` (at departure epoch)
    to a `target_body` (at arrival epoch), with the states of the `departure_body` and the `target_body`
    defined by ephemerides stored inside the `bodies` (`SystemOfBodies` instance). Note that this solver
    assumes that the transfer departs/arrives to/from the center of mass of the departure and the target body.

    Parameters
    ----------
    bodies: environment.SystemOfBodies
        Body objects defining the physical simulation environment
    departure_body: str
        The name of the body from which the transfer is to be computed
    target_body: str
        The name of the body to which the transfer is to be computed
    departure_epoch: int
        Epoch at which the departure from the `target_body`'s center of mass is to take place
    arrival_epoch: int
        Epoch at which the arrival at he target body's center of mass is to take place

    Output
    ------
    ΔV_launch: float
        ΔV required for insertion into the Lambert transfer arc
    ΔV_arrival: float
        ΔV required for capture by the arrival body
